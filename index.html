        <h2>Cynthia Hutauruk</h2>
        <h3>Welcome! Let's get started.</h3>
            <p>Allow me to share a few details about who I am. When I was five years old, my family and I moved from Bandung, Indonesia to Los Angeles, California; eventually transplanting to Colorado in 1996. Currently, I am finishing up a minor in Computer Information Systems to receive my Bachelors of Science in Psychology. I am interested in taking this software engineering bootcamp to find an opportunity in healthcare finance and research analysis. My mission is to create accurate patient narratives through data.</p>

            <p>If you're interested in connecting professionally, you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthiahutauruk/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
            
            <p> On the weekends, you will usually find me doing one of these three activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Myself and my year old Frenchton, Durian, training at an obedience class, socializing at dog parks, or going offroading with her pitbull puppy bff.</li>
                <li>Curled up reading a fantasy book or playing RPG/MOBA mobile games</li>
                <li>Tending to multiple houseplants in the basement</li>
                
            </ul>
